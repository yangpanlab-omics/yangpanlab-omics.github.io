I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago. I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics at UCLA under the mentorship of Dr. Yi Xing (Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia/UPenn) and my postdoctoral training with Dr. Tanika Kelly at Tulane University and the University of Illinois Chicago, supported by an NIH/NIA K99 award.

Trained in bioinformatics and epidemiology with a focus on molecular (omics) data, my research leverages large-scale omics and computational approaches to uncover mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases, with particular interest in clonal hematopoiesis, mitochondrial genomics, and multi-omics integration.

Outside research, I enjoy reading (including audiobooks), sports, and spending time with my family.
