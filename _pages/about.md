**Hello** from Dr. Yang Pan's Laboratory of **Omics and Computational Precision Health** at the University of Illinois Chicago! 

Our lab focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying aging-related diseases through multi-omics and computational precision health approaches. We integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging data to identify biomarkers, uncover causal pathways, and develop predictive models for precision interventions.

Key research areas:

**1. Aging Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genomics:** Investigating somatic mutations, including clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) and mitochondrial genome alterations, to understand their roles in chronic kidney disease, cognitive impairment, and other aging-related conditions.

**2. Multi-Omics Integration:** Developing computational and machine learning frameworks to combine genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and emerging modalities such as single-cell and spatial omics for disease risk prediction.

**3. Computational Precision Health:** Creating bioinformatics methods to integrate complex omics datasets, enabling predictive modeling, causal inference, and identification of novel therapeutic targets.

**Our mission** is to leverage multi-omics data and advanced computational approaches to improve disease risk prediction, stratify patients for precision interventions, and ultimately inform strategies to delay or prevent age-related chronic diseases.
